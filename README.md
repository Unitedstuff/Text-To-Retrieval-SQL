# Text-To-Retrieval-SQL
This project is a Streamlit web application that uses Google Gemini (via the google-generativeai API) to convert natural language questions into SQL queries. Users can type questions about student data. The app demonstrates prompt engineering, safe SQL extraction, and seamless integration of LLMs with database-backed applications.
